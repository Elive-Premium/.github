# Elive Premium

The purpose of this Git Organization is to provide to the Elive supporters (Patreon supporters or collaborators) direct access to premium features to thank them for their support

[Participate and be a member!](https://elivecd.org/patreon).

After that, you can simply run this command in your terminal:


```text

```

## Cloning options

Since these repositories are private, you cannot clone them directly in other machines, if you want to do that [we recommend to follow these steps](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70320541/1561066) in order to [create a token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) and then you can clone your repo, then you can do anywhere something like: 

```bash
git clone https://YOURTOKEN@github.com/Elive-Premium/elive-for-servers.git
```
